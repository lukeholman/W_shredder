# Data

The directory `mating_type_tables` holds lots of .rds files, generated by `set_up_mating_type_tables()`.

The directory `sim_results` holds lots of .rds files, generated by `run_simulation()`.

To save space in Git, neither of these directories are tracked (the latter in particular has very many small files). But their results are processed and placed in the file all_results.rds by the function `combine_results_files()`, and this master file _is_ tracked by Git.
